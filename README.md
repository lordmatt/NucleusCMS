NucleusCMS
==========

I love NucleusCMs but I have been feeling the pull in a different direction for a while now. I honestly hope that these experiments will create either a great new project that is as much fun as NucleusCMS has been or will simly be part of the furture of nucleusCMs and have some ideas merged back into the trunk.

I have the utmost respect for the NucleusCMS coders and supporters and am making this fork not to leave the community but to provide what I hope will be some interesting new ideas.
